I spend my life on bullet trains,
And planes and boats and cars;
I've seen the wonders of the world,
And gazed upon the stars;
I thought that I had seen all that,
There was on earth to see;
Then you walked in and pulled the rug,
Right out from under me;
Who'd have guessed I'd be so impressed;

I've seen the Pyramids of Giza,
The tilty Tower in Pisa;
But, baby, they just don't do what you do,
'Cause you're larger than life

Some say the blue Atlantic,
Is really quite gigantic;
Well, maybe,
I just don't see what they do,
'Cause you're larger than life

Zeus and all his thunder,
Liked to get his kicks;
With the spell I'm under,
I don't need parlour tricks;

I've seen the falls of Niagara,
The theorum of Pythagoras,
But, baby, they just don't do what you do,
'Cause you're larger than life

Zeus and all his thunder,
Liked to get his kicks;
With the spell I'm under,
I don't need parlour tricks;

Well, this worldly Nova Scotian,
Will give you her devotion,
So if you've got the notion,
Let's cause a real commotion,
Let me give you a clue,
If it was just me and you,
You'd see with only us two,
That, baby, we could be larger than life
